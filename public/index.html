      content="A couple of decades ago, real estate listings around the world were published in a catalog format on a bimonthly or weekly basis; however, listings in Los Cabos used to take up to a year to be published. By the end of the 20th century, real estate agents from various associations regularly gathered to share information about properties that were available for sale. They agreed to compensate brokers who helped sell those properties, and, as a result, the first MLS BCS was born. With the collaboration of its members, this new model has significantly strengthened the real estate sector and offered major benefits with the aid of emerging technologies"

      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.
